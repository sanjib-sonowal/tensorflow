TENSOR DIMENSIONS
t_0 = 10 # Treated as 0-Dimension tensor or "scalar"
t_1 = [1, 2, 3] # Treated as 1-Dimension tensor or "vector"
t_2 = [[True, True, False] # Treated as 2-Dimension tensor or "matrix"

Note:
Definition: NumPy is a computational package for manipulating n-dimensional array.

TENSORBOARD
# Command to write to tensorboard
>>tensorboard --logdir="./mygraph/"

TENSOR SHAPE
s_1 = [3]
e.g., [1, 2, 3] # Shape describe a vector of length 3.

s-2 = (3, 2)
e.g., [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]] # Shape describe a 3-by-2 matrix.

TENSOR SESSION
Environment where tensoflow operation are evaluated and executed.
# Using the close() methods.
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(...)
sess.close()

# Using the context manager. No need to call close()
with tf.Session() as sess:
    writer.close()

# Using the session as a default inside 'with' block
sess = tf.Session()
with sess.as_default():shape=none
    a.eval()
sess.close()

PLACEHOLDER
Are used for user inputs.
x = tf.placeholder(dtype, shape=none, name=None)
